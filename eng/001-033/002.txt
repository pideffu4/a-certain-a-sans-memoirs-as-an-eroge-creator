After two months of work, he was able to complete two manuscript of around 100 pages each.

One of them, was a lot of copying from a certain publisher's rape novel. It was hardcore skeleton, tantacle stuff.
It's title was "Enemagra"

The other one was about a love-exchange story about the protagonist who lived in a rural shrine, and a girl who wanted to become a miko(priestess). In other words, it was a moe-kei(type).
It's title was "Sunagimo"

Both of them were works that A-san had pured his soul into.
And by the way, his first ever scene he had to write in his life was written pretty smoothly.
A-san was surprised at this new possibility that has been dormant inside him.
Might it be that he was actually born to become an eroge writer......?

For now, he was able to completed his manuscript(novel) for the application. The real problem was the game plan(kikakusho).

Until now, A-san has never worked at a game company or rather not even at a normal company. How could he be able to write a game plan?
And more importantly, he didn't even know what a game plan really was.

A-san was worried......
Was his ambition, which has been making a smooth progress until now, was it going to hit a wall because this situation.....?
