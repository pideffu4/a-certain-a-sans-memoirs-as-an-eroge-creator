From that day, A-san started to receive rejection letters from the companied he had applied to almost everyday.
They came from both big, and smaller companies(softhouses).
The content of the rejection notice were all pretty blunt.

"Thank you very much for your application to our company.
The conclusion of our review is negative, we are unable to give an offer this time.
We pray for A-sama's future success"

3 mere lines.
There wasn't a significant difference in any of the other emails.
There were even some companies who corteously mailed the application material back.

--Damn it......

A-san told himself: None of the famous companies would take an unexperienced person like him seriously.

With rejection notices coming everyday. A-san stopped getting so disappointmented from them.

Is was impossible after all.......?
For a novice like himself to suddenly want to become a writer on a whim...

--Is it that really, the world doesn't work like that......?
