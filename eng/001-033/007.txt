The number of games crushed finally surpassed the number of fingers on both hands.
And at last as if to give the already irritated A-san a final blow, 
A rejection letter came from a company he had never even heard of before.
That moment, A-san perceived this battle as lost.

--Suicide......

There were still more than half of companies whose reply has not arrived yet.
But, looking at the results so far, hopes are faint.
If at least, he could have his last moments without so much pain.......
A-san changed into his white kimono, prepared to die, he turned on his PC to remove the porn videos.

-- There was a new e-mail......

The sender was one the companies he had applied to.
It is located in Tokyo, a brand new rising company, a rape game maker.

It's just another rejection anyways...
Given up most of hope, A-san opened the e-mail.

"Thank you very much for applying for our position.
Consequently, we would like to have an interview with A-sama on a day that is of your convenience.
May I receive a reply telling us when you can be available?"

-- It's here.....

Taking off the white kimono he had just put on, A-san started dancing weirdly in front of the PC.
