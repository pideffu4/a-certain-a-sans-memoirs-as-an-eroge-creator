So it's this guy........
It's a bit rude to say "this guy", but the man standing behind just seemed like friendly young adult, no sign of being a someone involved with some rape game production or otherwise Eroges.

And there was his age, he may be the same age as A-san, or even younger.
Slim pants, polo shirt. Slightly tanned skin.
On the one hand carrying a cleaerfile, and glasses with no margins on the other. ***
If you just glanced at him, he would just seem one of those (just graduated) university student you see everywhere. 
Is such a refreshing guy......

"Nice to meet you. I'm the representant of the softhouse called OO. My name is B."

A-san greeted back with a nice to meet you.

"So, it's a bit unconvenient to talk here. Let's go somewhere?"

A-san had presumed that the interview would take place at the company. He had not expected this.
With B-shi showing the way, they arrived at a family restaurant.

-- An interview......... here?

And it was right at lunch time, the family restaurant was crowded with other customers.
Noisy brat was squealing and running around.

-- You, telling me to have my life-changing battle, in here......?

"You can sit here."
B-shi, as if nothing, followed behind the waiter.

-- Ok, it can't be helped. You're telling me to fight here? I'll just gonna do it.

I'm a man--. I'm not going to whine about some terrain disadvantage.
