You could hear birds singing from far away.
After taking the order, B-shi took out from a clearfile the resume and the works A-san had sent.

That signaled the start he of battle---.

B-san sipped the ice tea the waiter had brought.
And then, gave a glance at the stiff and nervous A-san.

That is such an obvious thing.
Of course, A-san gave a yes.

"I see. If you're wondering why I'm making sure of such an obviuos thing, it's because, there are a lot of applicants who apply to us without knowing that........"

He's a person who talks calmly.

B-shi, holding A-san's resume in his hand, asked a few quesitons.
