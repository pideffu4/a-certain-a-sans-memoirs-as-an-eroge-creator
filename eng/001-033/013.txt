"The thing is, you know, our company. Right now, we're prducing a new product, plus 2 other works are also on progress.
The open position is for the later, someone who will be writing for those 2 other works..... And well, assuming A-san does come working with us,
We'll have you position you as a sub-writer as you don't have any previous working experience."

The conversation was getting to the point. A-san's heartbeat sped up.

He is talking about details, does that mean that he wants me?
That is very likely. I'll make that assumption for now.

But, B-shi's talk about "details" didn't go on,
they went back to talk about some recently released movies.

After 30 minutes.

"Then, thank you for today. I'll be back to company and continue to evaluate the decision. You're ok with me sending you the application result by e-mail right?"

The inteview had ended.
Timewise, it lasted 1 hour.

Was that long, or short? A-san could not know.

"I'll be waiting for the result"

Back to station gate, B-shi who had accompanied A-san here, bowed down his head and took his road home.
