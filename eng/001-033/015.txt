Right now, C-shi's company is making games.
They're putting a lot of effort into a rape game, but the fact is they're short of writers.
And this is where A-san comes in. He would be produce text for them in the form of outsource.
What he'll write will be fragmented H scenes only.
It was a sudden offer for A-san.
But, he didn't know the meaning of that "Outsource".
"Is is different from a company employee?"
A-san asked that, and C-shi kindly responsed that they were different.

Outsource.....
He'll commute to company once a week, and for everything else, he'll work from home.
A-san was lost.
For the inexperienced A-san, and outsource offer was more than good.
If he takes this offer, he'll be able to free himself from the "No Experience" tag and he would be freed from the guilt of having to rely on his parents.
But the problem was that if he did take on the job, he would then not know how to respond when B-shi's notice comes.
