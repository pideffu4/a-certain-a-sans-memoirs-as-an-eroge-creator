After the first 5 hours.......
As to be expected from a big game from a big company, in 5 hours you can't even complete one route.
According to the voices on the internet, it would take 40hours to get a full complete.

This extended play-time was also a factor that raised this big-game's rating.
2 hours later...... A-san was finally able to clear one heroine.

So tired......
The time needed to get to one ending was 7 hours.
You can't really enjoy the whole story if you play it in this manner.
But this is the best rated game right now.

"....."

A-san did realize one thing.
The game's play-time, in other words the quantity of the scenario.
As a general rule, it's said that 100k  = 1 hour.
If it takes as much as 40 hours for a full complete, with a simple calculation, the quantity of scenario would be 4M.
If a writer writes 200k per month, and assuming one writer write the entire 4M of scenario, it would take 20months.
And that is just purely the writing time for the scenario.
If you add in all other tasks, the development period would be over 2 years.
Even if you allocate the scenario to other writers, 200k per month is still slow.
