And of course, no matter how much you can write per month, if it's content is shit, everything is uselss.
But right now we have entered this period of "scenario inflation".
This big game that A-san had played, it was the extended play-time that factored for the support and positive ratings from users.
Yet he himself writes mere 80k per month,

Looking at the current industry trends, one can't be called a writer with that.......

According to rumors, a certain famous writer who was able to hit a big game with a doujin, was writing 40pages of manuscript everyday.
That's equivalent of doing A-san's 1 months worth of work in 2 days.
If you compare yourself with that writer, A-san's productivity is indeed low.

"Write good material fast. That's a taken for a pro"

A-san was burning.
He cannot let it end like this.
Without any delay, he takes out a new keyboard from the closet, and starts the production of a scenario which he had already concepted and refined in his mind.
