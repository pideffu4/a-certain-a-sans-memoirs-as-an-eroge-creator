And of course, no matter how much you can write per month, if it's contet is shit, it's all uselss.
Buy, right now if the period of "scenario inflation".
The big game that A-san had played, the extended play-time was a factor for the support and positive ratings from users.
But he himself writes barely 80k per month,

Looking at current industry trends, one can't be called a writer with that.......

According to rumors, a certain famous writer who was able to hit a big game with a doujin, would write 40pages of manuscript everyday.
That's equivalent of doing A-san's 1 months worth of work in 2 days.
If you compare yourself with that writer, A-san's productivity is indeed low.

"Write good stuff fast. That's obviuos for a pro"

A-san was burning.
He cannot let it end like this.
Without any delay, he takes out a new keyboard from the closet, and starts the production of a scenario which he had already concepted and refined in his mind.
