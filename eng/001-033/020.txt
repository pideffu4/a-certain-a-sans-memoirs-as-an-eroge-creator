-- Put aside the scenario's content for a moment.
     Because it depends the writer's sense, it's not something that can be overcome with effort only.
     But, with effort, you can do something in order to increasing the quantity of the writing. (A-san's father's words.)

Raise the quality of the scenario, while at the same time, shorten the time required write it.
A-san set that to be his immediate goal.

Now that he thinks about it, until now he has only been focused on getting a hire from a company. But never did he take his time to objectively look at his writing level.
As long as you work as a pro and receive money from the company, it's already a taken that you need to have a considerable degree of skills.
It might be a too late now, but A-san had finally reached this insight.

The only way to improve his writing skills was to write write write.
And also, read books, absorb a lot in order to polish one's sense.
There's probably no other way other than those two.
A-san's age was 25. It's very tough for an inexperienced writer, to enter the industry at this age.
There was not a minute, not a second to waste.
