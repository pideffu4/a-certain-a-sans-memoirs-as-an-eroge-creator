You may write a lot, but it is not effective if there isn't someone to evaluate it.
To solve this problem, A-san created a home page for the purpose of publishing his writings.
In order to attract more people, he derived the website's concept from a well known eroge website.
Once a week, he would upload the scenario he had written to the website.

At the same time, A-san would earn his livings with a part-time job.
, he started writing the scenario and game plan for the reapplication.

This time, he'll constrain the application to two companies, and have the scenario and game plan match the company's brand image.

There were no more replies from the 22 companies he had applied to.
The rejection notices came from roughly half of the 22 companies.
The others have not made a sound even after two months have passed.
A-san accepted it, that's just how things are.
His time now, is not poured into updating his website and the production of the new application material.

After day and days of busy work.........
And then a month,

One day, came a sudden notice.
