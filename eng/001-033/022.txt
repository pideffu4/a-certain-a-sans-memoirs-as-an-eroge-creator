Even if you do write, it is not effective if there isn't someone to evaluate it.
To solve this problem, A-san created a home page for the purpose of publishing his writings.
In order to attract more people, he derived the website's concept on a famous eroge website.
Once a week, he would upload the scenario he had written to the website.

At the same time, A-san would earn his livings with a part-time job.
, he started writing the scenario and game plan for the reapplication.

This time, he'll constrain the application to two companies, and make the scenario and game plan match the company's brand image.

There were no more replies from the 22 companies he applied.
The rejection notices came from roughly half of the 22 companies.
The others made no sound even after two months have passed.
A-san accepted this, that's just how things are.
His time now, is not poured into updating his website and the production of the new application material.

After day and days of busy work.........
And then a month,

One day, a sudden notice came.
