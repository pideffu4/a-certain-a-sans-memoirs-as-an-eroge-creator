A-san's cellphone rang.
The caller was a man.

He identified himself as the representative of "BackBone Soft", one of the companies A-san had applied to.
Since already 4 months had passed since A-san had applied. A-san didn't immediately recognize the name.
The man (D-shi) apologized for the late reply, and stated the business.

He wanted an interview with A-san.
Therefore, he wanted to know when A-san could be available.

It was the same development as during B-shi's case.
If it was the A-san from the past, he would have immediately took the chance.
But he frankly didn't have memory of D-shi's company.
He didn't even know the name of the games they produced.

A-san hesitated for a moment, but there is no reason on earth to let go such a rare chance.
A-san gave the day for the interview, and the other party confirmed it.

After hanging the phone, A-san opened the HP of the the interview company, D-shi's company (BackBone Soft).
It looked like they had released one game. It was a new company.
That would explain why he wasn't able to remember the its name.
When A-san applied to this company, they still hadn't released a single game.
The game that just came out last month, D-shi's company's game wan't really what A-san was looking for. It was a game moe game.
