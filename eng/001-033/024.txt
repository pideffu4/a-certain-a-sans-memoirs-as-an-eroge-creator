--Why is this company contacting me?

The fact that I got an interview is itself not normal.
A-san mainly played rape games most of th time. That fact is naturally reflected in his writings.
To put it into words, he was most confident in rape novels, and that should have been obvious from the manuscript he had sent.
If this is me then, why a company that made a moe-game contact me?

By this point, A-san was already firm that he would become a rape genre writer.
And of course, those two companies that he was preparing to apply were that genre as well.
That fuzzy A-san who jsut applied to any company is not in this world anymore.

--Might it be that, D-shi did not read the application works...
--Well, fine. A chance is a chance. If it looks like I can get it, so be it.

With a withering heart, A-san waited for the interview day.
