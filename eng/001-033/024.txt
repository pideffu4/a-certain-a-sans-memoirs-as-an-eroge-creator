--Why is this company contacting me?

The fact that I got an interview is itself not normal.
A-san played rape games most of the time. That fact is naturally reflected in his writings.
To put it into words, he was most confident in rape novels, and that should have been obvious from the manuscript he had sent.
If this is me then, why a company that made a moe-game contact me?

By this point, A-san was already firm that he would become a rape genre writer.
And of course, those two companies that he was preparing to apply were all in this genre.
That A-san without a clear objective who just applied to just any company does not exist anymore.

--Might it be that, D-shi did not read the application material...
--Well, fine. A chance is a chance. If it looks like I can get it, I'll do so.

With a withering heart, A-san waited for the interview day.
