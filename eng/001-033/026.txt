The interview proceeded.
The two man other than D-shi barely talked.
All what the thin man does is to writing notes on his foldable memo.
While all what the old man does is to nod at D-shi's words.

-- This is almost like a one on one with D-shi.

A-san smiled in his heart.

"We at BackBone soft, we just launched our first game, we're a new maker.
Well, it is kind of hard to make an evaluation when you have only one game.
We plan to release one game after another and grow this company.
With this in mind, We're looking for some new insipiration, in the form of new talent."

It was felt during the phone call as well, this D-shi did have some carisma.
Constrast that with B-shi...

D-shi asked the thin director next to him,
"E, the one we released, how many did it go?"
The man named E, with slight hisitation replied:
"4000..."

On the fly, the old man (F-shi) sitting on the opposite side whispered to D-shi:
"Well, well, D-shi. That might be an interesting point to bring up but... that's not really what A-san..."
"Oh yea. But, if A-san is to join us, we will have to talk about those details anyways no?"
D-shi, talking like an kid, exchanged words with F-shi.
