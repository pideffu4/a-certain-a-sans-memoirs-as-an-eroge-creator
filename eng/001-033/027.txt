By 4000, they mean the units of the game they sold...?
Only four thounds.... and this is a situation where they would want to make themselves look good...
They are only selling this much? Though A-san who did not know much about the industry's information.

"Nahaha, well ok.
A-san, did you play our game?"

He had expected this. To prepare for this question, A-san did buy the game and tried to play it, he was relieved he did that.

"Yes, I did play it"
"Which girl did you like?"
"Ha? Which heroine? Yeah. That small girl I guess..."

You can say he went thought the game, or rather, not only did he not get a full complete, but he didn't even clear a single route.
To be honest, he didn't even remember the names of all heroines
But, if its a moe-game, there is usually always character who takes the loli role.

"You mean Aoi-tan? eh? Might it be that A-san is a lolicon?
he--. You're that type..."

Like that, D-shi went on to make his own conclusion.
E-san and F-san, looked at D-san dumbfolded.
Those 3 of them. They looks almost if as they don't usually get along very well.
