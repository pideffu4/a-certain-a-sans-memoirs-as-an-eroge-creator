[DRAFT]
After that, D-shi started talking about the game plan and novel which A-san had sent.
According to D-shi, the novels, especially the moe-scenario "Sunagimo" was not bad.
But the rape novel was no good. It was not at pro level.
A-san who was confident in rape-type, had to doubt at the words in his ears.

"But I do think you did a good job on both of them. The writing is still abit unexperienced through.
If you get more experience, you will able to do it I think... right?"
D-shi asked to E-shi sitted next to him.
E-shi just forced a smile on his face.

--That forced smile, what does that mean?

Those were mostly strict/negative feedback but,
Compared to B-shi's time, where they did not even mention his works, being able to hear other people's opinios was already very satisfying.

"If you were to join us, what game would A-san like to make?"
that came from F-shi.

A-san, thought about it. D-shi's company was's direction was completely different from his own.
In this situation, would it best to straighforwrdly say that he wants to make a rape-type...? He was thinking.
