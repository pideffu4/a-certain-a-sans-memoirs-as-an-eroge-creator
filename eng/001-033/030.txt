"Moe and rape, I want to make them one and pioneer a new genre"
And, a hybrid answer like that was replied.
In response to that, D-san:
"That is, what exactly?"

"Eh? Ehh...."

He could not asnwer.
After all, to come up with it on the moment, was not something that could be done.
In his heart, he was like "shit." it was too late to even regret.
D-shi, without expecting an answer from A-san said:
"You know what, we..."
Started to talk about his own company again.

According to what D-shi says, BackBone soft has a "Moe" direction.
In those regards, they want to use A-san's "Sunagimo" as the concept and produce a game base on it.
Of course, if the company gets large enough, they may able to spin off a new brand to pursue a different direction, but for now they are going for one moe-game only.

--That makes sense...

A-san nodded.
It was different from what A-san wanted to do but. D-san had his own vision and he made it very clear.

As if being supressed by D-shi's strong words, in the back of A-san's mind, that "moe" phrase remained inscribed inside him.
