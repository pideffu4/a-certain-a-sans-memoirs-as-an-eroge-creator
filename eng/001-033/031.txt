The duration of the interview was around 1 hour he guessed.
And during this time, D-san was always the one talking.

At last, E-shi who had been quiet until now, opened his mout:
"A-san, how much scenario can you write in 1 month?"

And as expected, this question came out here as well.
As A-san had predicted, right now, every company is in demand for a writer who can write large quantities...
Is that assumption correct? A-san was anxious thinking about it.
If it is a maker aiming to release a big mainstream game, then that must be what they are thinking.

A-san proudly said: 

"I can write 300k per month"

"Hee. I see. G-sensei who was responsible for our game this time, what was his pace?"
asked D-shi to E-shi.

"It was about... 250k I recall"
"Since in four months, it didn't total up to 1M."
D-san's large body bounced in a "I see I see" manner.

And then, he said back to A-san:
"Users right now, are very sensitive about the play time.
No matter what kind of text the writer writes, if the play time is only 4 hours, there no way it gets a good rating,
If you look at the game called XX that came out earlier, you will see why.
Therefore, for our company we do like good content of course, but we really need someone who can write in high volumes.
And in this regard, it seems like it won't be problem for A-san"
