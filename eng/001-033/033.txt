[DRAFT]
"Hired". They wanted him to start coming at the start of next month. A-san accepted and hang the phone.

--I got in.

He was not happy. Rather, the opposite.

--Why I am so worried/anxious.

He had been working only to get into a company as a writer until now. And finally his wish was realized. He should be happy no matter how you look at it.
But, for some reason A-san could not enjoy it honestly.

There are two reasons for it.
First, his moe-key work which himself was not convinced of got a opnions from them. If it would be possible, he wished he would have been hired because of the rape-scenario he had wrote.

The other erason was about D-shi.
This is coming from A-san who does not have any experience in a company, but D-shi does not really feel like he is fit to be the representative of a company.
In some aspects, he is like a kid, and is too self-centric.
F-shi who made up for D-shi, even F-shi looked at D-shi with some cold eyes.

But, there is no help in worrying about it. He's already passed a point he can't turn back.
A-san's life as a writer starts from here.
From now on, he's a member of "SpinalCord Soft", and he's going to put himself into the erogame industry.
His first day was approaching, A-san's heart was getting high.
