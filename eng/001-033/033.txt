"Hired". They wanted him to start coming at the start of next month. A-san accepted and hang the phone.

--I got in.

He was not happy. Rather, the opposite.

--Why I am so worried?

He had been working all along only to get into a company as a writer. And finally his wish had been realized. He should have been happy, no matter how you looked at it.
But, for some reason A-san could not enjoy in a natural way.

There are two reasons for it.
First, his moe-key work which himself was not convinced of, got good opnions from them. If it would be possible, he wished he would have been hired because of the rape-scenario he had wrote.

The other reason was about D-shi.
This is coming from A-san who does not have any experience in a company, but it did not really feel like D-shi was an adeguate person to be the boss of a company.
In some aspects, he is like a kid, too self-centric.
Even F-shi who covered for some of D-shi's behaviour, looked at D-shi with some cold eyes.

But, there is no help in worrying about it. He's already passed a point he can't turn back.
A-san's life as a writer starts from here.
From now on, he's a member of "BackBone Soft", and he's going to pour himself into the erogame industry.
His first day was approaching, A-san's heart was getting high.
