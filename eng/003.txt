A-san was stuck at the production of the game plan.
One day, while he was killing time by looking at the home page of a game creator he was aiming for, with strike of luck, he found a content called "How to write a game plan".
A-san viewed that lecture with high hopes, but only to end up shocked.

-----------------
~There were many questions about it, so I'll explain how a game plan is written~
1. The title on the cover, make it big.

2. Make the heading/caption stand out and easy to understand.

3. The most important thing is to have the reader understand what kind/type of game this is.

4. There is no a real need for pictures or diagrams. There are no problems as long as it's easy and interesting to read.

  The rest will depend on the content you come up with.
  Good luck.
-----------------

That was it.
In front of the display, with the mouse still in his hand, A-san remaind dumbfolded for 5 minutes.

--So, in the end ... it depends on the content?
--Are you saying that ... a game plan can be anything?

That game plan lecture that was supposed to be a gift from the sky, but instead, it made A-san even more confused.

But time is ticking moment by moment.
And his savings, they are already about to hit the a bottom.
This is bad.........
