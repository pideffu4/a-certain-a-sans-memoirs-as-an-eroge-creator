A-san, being forced into a corner, decided that he had to write this game plan in any case.
It doesn't matter if they laugh at or criticize it......
Right now count on his own skills and do all that he can to can to push on.
Almost in a desperate-like state, A-san started working on the production of the game plan.

.....

The next day, by spending all night on it, he finally came up with 3 game plans.
The titles were: "The school's insane mania" "Legstured"  "Moon Celeb"
One rape work. One foot fetish work. One romance moe-kei work.
A summary of the content would be:
- 1st page. A huge title on the cover.
- 2nd page. The concept.
- 3rd page. Character introduction.
- 4th page. Plot.

Each game plan had only 4 mere pages.
Moreover, they were all so unrefined.
Some companies had even indicated to specify the number of pages of the background sceneries or the number of tracks to be used.
But for a novice like A-san, there was no way he could know such a thing, so he gave up on those.
For this game plan, A-san had to be pratical and put his sentiments aside.

Right now, this was the most that A-san could for a game plan.
Those works were almost like parts of A-san himself. With those works, he stood up to head against the eroge industry's great wall before him.

The fire and boiling ambition from deep inside A-san, filled his burning body in crimson.
