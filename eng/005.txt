By finishing sending his resume and copy of his works to 22 companies, A-san had applied with his works to all the 22 companied that he had listed up.

What could be done was all done.
All there was to do now was to wait.......

At the top of the mansion's roof, the night scene could be viewed.
The expression of the naked A-san leaning the glass of Brandy was filled with feeling of liberalization.

....

3 days later.
11 am before noon.
A quick e-mail from a company he had applied had arrived.
That compnay was a big player from the West.
The result was obviously, rejected.
A-san let down his shoulders in disappointment. So a big company was impossible for an unexperienced one like him after all......?
That company (softhouse) was one that A-san loved. It was his first choise this time.
But, no matter how much he is discouraged, a rejection is a rejection.
A-san finished his lunch, and took out the games that have been sleeping inside his closed. With the implication of his preparedness, he crushed the games with the hatchet.

And besides, isn't that rejection notice a bit too fast?
Hey, the application was sent just 3 days ago. Did they properly read the works that were sent?

Doubs came and went from A-san's chest.
If the reason for the rejection was because of lack of experience, this fight may be unexpectedly--.
"This fight will be tough......."
