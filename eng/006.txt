From this day, a rejection letter from a company that was applied arrived to A-san.
They were all from big, middle companies(softhouses).
The content of the rejection notice were all so blunt/cold.

"Thank you very much for your application to our company.
The conclusion of our examination is, we will skip/go over an offer this time.
We pray for A-sama's future development/success"

3 mere lines.
There was no big difference from e-mails and mails.
There were even some companies who corteously mailed me my application material back.

--Damn it......

From the well known makers, someone without experience like A-san, would not be considered. A-san finally understood that.
With rejection notices coming everyday. After a week, he stopped getting disappointmented.

Is it all failed after all.......
For a novice like me who suddenly wanted to become a writed on a whim, does that mean

--Society isn't that naive/ideal after all......?
