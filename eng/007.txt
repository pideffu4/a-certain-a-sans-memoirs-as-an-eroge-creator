The number of games that were crushed, had finally surpaseed the number of fingers on both hands.
And then, as if to give the irritated/impatient A-san the final blow, 
A rejection letter from a company he had never heard before reached to him.
That moment, A-san had perceived that this fight was lost.

--Suicide......

There are still more than half of companies whose reply has not yet arrived.
But, by looking at the result so far, the hopes are faint.
At least, let the last moment end without pain.......
A-san changed into his white kimono, before dying, he turned on his PC to delete the porn videos.

-- One e-mail had arrived......

The sender was one the companies he had applied to.
It is located in Tokyo, a brand new rising company, a rape game maker.

It's just another rejection anyways...
Given up most of hope, A-san opened the e-mail.

"Thank you very much for applying for our position.
Consequently, we would like to have an interview with A-sama on a date that is convenient for you.
May I receive a reply on when you can be available?"

-- It's here.....

Taking off the white kimono he had just put on, A-san started a dancing suspicously in front of the PC.
