Interview----.
That word, how much did A-san continue wishing it.

A day when he can be available? A-san had so much time that it was rotting.

But, if now he "If it's about time, I'm always free, how about we immediately meet tomorrow"
replies like that, he'll be take as a carefree// person....

After thinking about it, A-san settled it on that week's friday, he quickly decided the interview day.

He is becoming more and more excited and anxious.
There is still some time before the interview day.
He tried on the suit that has been sleeping in the clost since the adult day.
He even had a hair-cut, and ordering his appearnce.

The day of the interview arrived.
A-san put on his fitting suit, and went down, at the appointed station.
After arriving at the station, he was to contact.
He took out his phone, to tell that he had arrived.

10 minutes later......

"Are you A-san?"
Someone called from his back all of a sudden, A-san replied with some surprise,
"Yes it's me."
And, with a smile that he hadn't even showed to his father, he turned around.
