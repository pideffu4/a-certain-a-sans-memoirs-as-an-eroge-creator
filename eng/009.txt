It's this guy........
It's a bit rude to say this guy, but the man standing behind me was,
not someone who looked to be involved with some Eroge, rape game prodution, but a good refreshing young man.
His age is... in a bad case, he may be the same age as A-san, otherwise even younger.
Slim pants, polo shirt. Slightly tanned skin.
On the one hand carrying a clearcase/cleaerfile, and glasses with no margins.
With one sight, he would just seem one of those (just graduated) university student you see everywhere. 
Is such a refreshing guy......

"Nice to meet you. I'm the representant of the softhouse called OO. My name is B."

With a nice to meet you, A-san greets back.

"Then, we can't really talk here, so let's go somewhere?"

A-san had presumed that the interview would take place at the company, he received a surprise hit.
With B-shi showing the way, they arrived at a family restaurant.

-- An interview......... here?

And it was just lunch time, the family restaurant was crowded with other customers.
Some noisy brat was squealing and running around inside,

-- You, telling me to have my fight that will change my life, in here......?

"Please, here."
B-shi, not minding the surroundings, followed behind the waiter showing the way.

-- This can't be helped. If you'll telling me to fight here, I'll just do it.

I'm a man--. I'm to say excuses/complain that ground was disadvantageous.
