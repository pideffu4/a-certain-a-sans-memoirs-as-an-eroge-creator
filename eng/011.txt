B-shi's questions were:

- What are you doing right no? What job did you have before?
- Are you living with you parents?
- Did you ever get a job in this industry before?

And so on, it was almost all the same stuff written on the resume. With questions being asked, A-san while bewildered, propery answered them one by one.
The usual questions ended.
The next one is finally, going to be about the works that A-san had sent, so he thought.
A-san's prediction was off.

"A-san, do you play any eroge?"

B-shi's stiffen/formal tone changed all of a sudden,

///

"Yes, I do play them"

A-san replied honestly.
Why would someone who doesn't play eroge apply here? So he thought in his mind.

"Do/did you play the games we make?"

On that, A-san replied is extreme obvious/natural.

"I did"

So, he answered.
