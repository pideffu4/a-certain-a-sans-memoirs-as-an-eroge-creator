B-shi's questions were:

- What are you doing right now? What job did you have before?
- Are you living with you parents?
- Did you ever get a job in this sector before?

It went on like that, it was almost all the same stuff he had written on the resume.
At each question, A-san politely gave an answer, one by one.
That was if of the usual questions.
The next one was finally going to be about the material A-san had sent, or so he thought.
A-san's prediction was off.

"A-san, do you play any eroge?"

All of a sudden, B-shi's dropped the formal tone.
It was like a senpai in a company asking a casual question.

"Yes, I do play them"

A-san honestly replied.
Why would someone who doesn't play eroge apply here? He said in his mind.

"Do you also play the games we make?"

A-san replied to the question in a totally natural manner.

"I do"

So, he answered.
