"Then, how about the one which recently came out, XX from (A work from a big company)?"

A-san didn't play that, therefore, he shook his head horizontally.

B-shi, went on to talk about eroge, anime, manga and even movies and drama. It wasn't a talk you would expect from an interview.

A-san, bending the limits of his body, answered to the questions.

Eventually, they went on having an enthusiastic talk about movies.

-- So, you are saying that an interview can be anything?

A-san thought half-heartedly, while talking B-shi.
After a session of the topic ended, Finally B-shi starts:

"If you start writing the scenario for a game, how much quantity can you write in one day?"

He asked a on topic question.

"In one month, about 200k I guess?"
"Is that so..... That's a bit slow huh"

That's right.
He had no knowledge on how fast people write,
Maybe he should have lied a say "1M". A-san regretted.
