-- Let's put aside the scenario's content for a moment.
   Because it depends the writer's sense, it's not something that can be overcome with just effort.
   But, with effort, you can do something in order to increasing the quantity of the writing. (A-san's father's words.)

Raise the quality of the scenario, while at the same time, shorten the time it takes write it.
A-san set that to be his immediate goal.

Now that he thinks about it, until now he has only been focused on getting a hire from a company. But neglected to objectively look at his level as writer.
As long as you work as a pro and take money from the company, it's already a taken that you need to have a considerable degree of skill.
It might be a too late now, but A-san has finally reached this insight.

The only way to improve his writing skills to write write write.
And also, read books, absorb a lot and polish one's sense.
There's probably no other way other than those.
A-san's age was 25. It's very tough for an inexperienced writer, to enter the industry at this age.
There was not minute, not second to waste.
