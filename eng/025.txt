The day of the interview.
Waiting at the station, a man with sunglasses with big shoulders appeared.
He was the one on the phone call, SpinalCord's representative, D-shi.
Two men followed behind him.
One was a thin man contrasting D-shi.
The other was a bald man.
D-shi explained to A-san that thin man as the director, and the older man as one of the directors/boards ***. 

--To think that there would be 3 of them...

A-san was carried to a cafe nearby the staion, and had his interview.

Not unexpected but, he was more stressed than the first interview.
