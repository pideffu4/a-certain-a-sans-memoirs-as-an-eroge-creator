"Moe and rape, I want to make them one and pioneer a new genre"
And, a half-complete answer like that was replied.
In response to that, D-san:
"That is, what exactly?"

"Eh? Ehh...."

He could not asnwer.
After all, to come up with it on the moment, was not something that could be done.
In his heart, he was like damn it/shit it was too late even to regret.
D-shi is, without expecting an answer from A-san,
"You know what, we..."
Started to talk about his own company again.

According to what D-shi says, SpinalCord soft has a "Moe" direction.
In those regards, they are want to use A-san's "Sunagimo" as the image and produce a game base on it.
Of course, if the company gets large enough, they may able to spinn of a new brand to pursue a different direction, but for now they are going for one moe-game and that's it.

--That makes sense...

A-san nodded.
It was different from what A-san wanted to do but. D-san, and had his own vision and it was very clear.

As if being supressed by D-shi's strong words, in the back of A-san's mind, that "moe" phrase was inscribed inside him.
