[DRAFT]
The duration of the interview should be around 1 hour he guessed.
And during this time, D-san was always the one talking.

At last, E-shi who had been quiet until now, opened his mout:
"A-san, how much scenario are you able to write in 1 month?"

And as expected, this question came out here as well.
As A-san had predicted, right now, every company is in demand for a writer who can write large quantities...
Isn't that not correct? A-san was anxious thinking about taht.
If it is a mker aiming to release a big mainstream game, then that must be what they are thinking.

A-san said proudly: 

"I can write 300k per month"

"Hee. I see. G-sensei who responsible for our game this time, what was his pace?"
asked D-shi to E-shi.

"It was about... 250k I recall"
"Since in four months, it didn't total 1M."
D-san's larget body bounced in a "I see I see" manner.

And then, he said back to A-san:
"Users right now, are very sensitive about the play time.
No matter what kind of text the writer writes, if the play time is only 4 hours, there no way it gets a good rating,
If you look at the game called ○○ that came out earlier, you will see why.
Therefore, for our company we do like good content as it will not hurt, but we really need someone who can write in high volume.
And for this point, it seems won't be problem for A-san"
