The first, five hours later.......
As to be expected from a big game from a big company, in 5 hours you can't even complete one route.
According to the voices on the internet, it would take 40hours to get a full complete.

This long play-time, was also a factor that raises this big-game's rating.
2 hours later...... A-san was finally able to clear one heroine.

So tired......
The time needed to get to one ending was 7 hours.
Playing like this, it's not surprise if he is not able to enjoy the story. ***
But this is the best rated game right now.

"....."

A-san did realize one thing.
It was about the game's play-time, in other words the quantity of the scenario.
As a general rule, it's said 100k  = 1 hour.
If it takes as much as 40 hours for a full complete, with a simple calculation, the quantity of scenario would be 4M.
If a writer writes 200k per month, and assuming one writer write the entire 4M of scenario, it would take 20months.
Moreover, that is just purely the writing time for the scenario.
If you add in all other tasks, the development period would be over 2 years.
Even if you allocate the scenario to other writers, 200k per month is still slow.
