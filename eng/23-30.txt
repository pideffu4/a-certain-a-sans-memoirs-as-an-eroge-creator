A-san's cellphone ringed.
The caller is a man.

It was from the company"Spine/backbone Soft" that A-san had previously applied, he called himself the representative.
As it has been already 4 months since he had applied, even with it saying the company's name, he didn't react immediatly.
The man (D-shi) apologized for the late reply, and sated the business.

He wanted an interview with A-san.
And so, he wanted an indication of a day when he would be available.

It was the same patter as B-shi's case.
If it was the A-san from before, he would have immediately taken a bite at it but,
To be honest, A-san didn't have memories of D-shi's company.
He didn't even know the name of the games he produced.

A-san hesitated for a moment, but there is no reason on earth to let go such a rare chance.
A-san indicated the day of the interview, and the other party confirmed it.

After hanging the phone, A-san opened the HP of the the interview company, D-shi's company (Backbone Soft).
It looks liket, if has just released one game, a new company.
It makes sense that he wasn't able to remember the game name.
When A-san applied to this company, they still hadn't realeased a single game.
The game that just came out last month, D-shi's company's game was a game you woudl go a bit eeeww, a moe game.
